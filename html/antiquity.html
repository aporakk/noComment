                    <p>Starting off our tour with the beginnings of literature, it is important to mention that many of the
                        oldest works of literature have been lost and many of the ones that survived hadn’t translated into
                        European languages in time. In other cases, scholars and archaeologists couldn’t identify the authors
                        of some of these works or any other characteristics of them, so they had to follow only theories
                        until today.
                        <br> There is also still that big debate going on about what is literature, and if it’s quite subjective
                        to believe that a certain written text is categorized among literature or not. However, there are
                        standard attributes in order to measure the weight of what is being said to a text and give it the
                        name of literature.</p>

                    <h2 class="content-title">Classical Period (1200 BCE - 476 CE)</h2>
                    <p>Ancient Greece’s civilization had a powerful influence in the foundation of Western Europe. Literature
                        was part of their culture since Greeks introduced new ways of acting and writing like drama, lyric
                        and epic poetry.</p>
                    <h3 class="text-title">I. Homeric or Heroic Period (1200-800 BCE):</h3>
                    <p>It is believed that before that period stories were being told only orally and that was the only way
                        to pass to future generations. Homer and Hesiod started writing these stories and they defined epic
                        poetry. These poems were long narratives about specific events with a hero. Usually the hero has
                        to face a great deal of life-threatening struggles thus hero’s bravery is demonstrated, many philosophical
                        issues of human society, and Gods are also demonstrated, trying to cause more problems to humanity
                        just for their entertainment. By overcoming them, the hero develops into someone who knows his own
                        flaws. Epics like these are The Iliad and The Odyssey by Homer, written between 800 and 500 BCE.
                        Hesiod is the father of didactic poetry and some of his works are Theogony and Works and Days, written
                        between 750 and 650 BCE. Hesiod doesn’t belong in Homeric period, yet his style of writing does.Lyric
                        poetry was introduced during this era but had some more acclaimed works to vivify in the Golden Age
                        of Greece. In this kind of poetry there is one person singing the poem with the accompany of music,
                        usually instruments like lyre, flute or cithara. The poet that sang lyric poems didn’t have to be
                        the writer of the poem as well. Archilochus was the first one who wrote such poetry at 700 BC, but
                        his full work hasn’t survived intact. The music that was playing beside the words of the poems was
                        just a few, which means we cannot understand completely how this combination of song and oral performance
                        was like. Sappho is known for her lyric poems, but most of her work is only in fragments. Only one
                        poem is not lost and that is the Ode to Aphrodite, in which Sappho asks Aphrodite for help to ease
                        her broken heart. In Roman Period there are Roman poets who were affected and wrote lyric poetry
                        like Catullus and Horace. However, Greeks passed their lyric meters to Latins. Each lyric poem is
                        following a specific meter like iambic or trochaic.</p>
                    <h3 class="text-title">II. Classical Greek Period (800-200 BCE):</h3>
                    <p>During the Greek Classical Period there was a sub-period, the Golden Age of Greece (499BCE-400BCE). The
                        growing of literature in that period was enormous. A great deal of progress was made on some literature
                        genres like epic poetry and lyric poetry while at the same time new genres were created. One of them
                        was drama, and its meaning was different than what it means today. Drama in ancient Greece is any
                        type of theatrical performance while today it means dramatic, with exaggerated characters that tend
                        to awake sensational emotions. This new genre came form lyric poetry. Lyric poetry as stated before
                        required oral performances that eventually led to drama itself and the establishment of theatres.
                        It began at festivals committed to the god Dionysus. Comedies, tragedies and tragicomedies (satyr
                        performances) are part of drama. At the same time actors began to build their careers, Thespis was
                        the first one that has ever been on stage. Some authors whose works have survived are Aeschylus (Oresteia
                        trilogy), Euripedes (Medea, The Trojan Women), Sophocles (Oedipus Rex). Each tried different styles,
                        some of them giving emphasis on dialogues, irony, criticizing society while others used comedy as
                        their weapon like Aristophanes (Lysistrata, The Frogs). Two other new genres of literature were philosophy
                        and histiography. Aristotle, Socrates and Plato contributed a lot to philosophy and to many scientific
                        disciplines. One of Aristotle's biggest works was Poetics, which was related to literary theories
                        of drama. On the other hand, Herodotus is the father of history, Thucydides wrote history and listed
                        his sources and Xenophon whote history and gave emphasis to war material.</p>
                    <h3 class="text-title">III. Classical Roman Period (200BCE - 445CE)</h3>
                    <p>Roman literature on its early stages imitated a whole lot of Greece's literature, especially when Rome
                        conquered Greece in 146 CE. Roman authors were trying to come up with their own versions of Greek
                        drama playwrights. They were taking the same stories and trying to make them fit in their own culture
                        with their own traditions. Some of them were: Virgil, who got influenced by Homer's Iliad in his
                        work Aeneid, Marcus Pacuvius, who wrote tragedies, Plautus, who wrote comedies influenced by Aristophanes.
                        Later on though some genuine works were created. Gaius Lucilius was the first one to write Roman
                        poetry amd publish his work in the 100s BCE and De Agri Cultura is the oldest Latin prose written
                        by Cato The Elder in 160 BCE. During the Roman Imperial period there are many Roman philosophers
                        like Marcus Aurelius and Lucretius. Marcus Aurelius believed in Stoic philosophy and has put his
                        thoughts on it in Meditations. During The Golden Roman Age (81BCE - 17CE) there is a sub-period called
                        the Age of Cicero. It took the name of Cicero because he has written more than any other Latin writter.
                        Some of his books have survived, some rhetoric and others philosohpy related. He has also written
                        letters and many speeches. The content on his work was mostly about how the life of Romans was. In
                        the Augustan Age there are poets like Virgil and Horace. They both were important figures of Rome.
                        Ovid was another poet who inspired lots of other poets in later periods of the Western world. Metamorphoses
                        by Ovid was a poem that tells the history of the world from its creation until Julius Caesar's idolization.</p>
                    <h3 class="text-title">IV. Patristic Period (70CE - 476CE)</h3>
                    <p>All the writings from the fathers of church, Apostles, popes, saints belong in the Patristics. Many books
                        had been written from 30CE, the death of Christ. The church though couldn't agree on what books should
                        be chosen to be in the Bible until 393CE. The content of these books was the life of Jesus and his
                        Apostles. Patristic period ends with the fall of Roman empire in 476CE. It is essential to mention
                        that some books of that era have not been approved by the church though academics nowadays still
                        use those books as sources. In relation to this, the church ignored many pagan works and kept only
                        the ones that were really important for the history of the Christianity. Simon Magus, Cerinthus,
                        Valentinus are some authors of that era, while Prudenitus and Coelius Sedulius were Christian poets.
                        Ignatius of Antioch with his books desrcibed the ceremonies of Church.</p>
