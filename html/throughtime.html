            This is where our LiteraTour begins. You will find information about Literary Periods, from ancient pre-medieval times till
            modern times. This attempt is being made to simply inform about the evolution of literature, to show how authors
            were influenced during the course of history and to present some of their most important work. Needless to say,
            that it is impossible to include every single author's work or to describe in any detail the one's that are being
            included.
