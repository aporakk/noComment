                    <p>The Modersnist Period starts at the beginning of the 20th century until perhaps 1965. That period has
                        in it two World Wars and it's a challenging one since both of these wars influenced literature. The
                        First World War (1914-1918) brought terror and horror to societies and for a moment people hoped
                        that there will be no other war to follow. Noone could ever imagine that the Second World War was
                        going to happen in such a short period. The characteristics of this literature era are the separation
                        from nature, the tendency of authors to experiment and the estrangement of people. There was also
                        the need to remove the importance of tradistions since this belonged in the past of Victorian age
                        and literature was seeking for something entirely new.</p>

                    <p>There were many figures that influenced this new era coming from the previous century, like Friedrich
                        Nietzsche and Sigmund Freud. In the Modern Literature there were some standards about which art would
                        be considered low and which one would be considered high. These standards were set by journals usually.
                        The fact that some artists didn't want to follow these standards lead them to alienation. That doesn't
                        mean that the reading audience would always like these standards, and sometimes these artists or
                        writers would still be successful. In the previous periods we could see that the equality in societies
                        was inconsiderable. People were being distinguished in classes and their family name and color skin
                        mattered. This was meant to change in the 20th century and it began with artists. Before, in the
                        19th century those artists voices wouldn't be heard in the public and would be dismissed. This is
                        the very first time that they have achieved something that seemed impossible, mostly because the
                        way of thinking of people was changing and there was tolerance for differentiation. Harlem Renaissance
                        took place in Harlem, New York during 1920s and it was an artistic outbreak. African-Americans were
                        then able to join. Apart from that, women were becoming the most influential figures of genres like
                        Imagism. Poets tend to consider the previous century's works unworthy except from Gerard Manley Hopkins
                        and the French Symbolists. Hopkins invented new poetic rhythms but he also never published his works.
                        He was just talented, he never got any education and one day he started writing. Poets today are
                        just like him, they teach their own selves and they do not really mind the criticism of the audience
                        about their works. During that period and the beginning of WWI there was another movement of poetry
                        called Imagism. In this movement the language that was used in poems was including only the most
                        valuable content and removing everything else. By using this minimalist approach the reader was focusing
                        only to the main point of the poem's words. The language was sharp, clear and the authors had the
                        advantage of choosing any topics that they wanted without focusing only on nature and beauty like
                        in previous eras. Some poets of that era are Ezra Pound, Hilda Doolittle, Amy Lowell, D.H. Lawrence.
                        One of the major poets of this century was Thomas Stearns Eliot (T.S. Eliot). His style of writing
                        was considered modern. The language he used was transforming unexpectedly from formal to a conversational
                        style because he liked to experiment. In his poem The Waste Land he experiments a lot by changing
                        his style throughout the poem, sometimes it even seemed more like prose rather than poetry. A group
                        of writers from America called The Lost Generation is part of Modernism. It was the time of the First
                        World War and those writers had lost the meaning of life. Ernest Hemingway was a writer of that era
                        and in the way he writes it is clear that he is steep and blunt and the language is simple. Novel
                        literature had some major changes in this period, the narrator was now unreliable and made readers
                        being not so sure about what was happening in novels, questioning even facts that were supposed to
                        be clear. This can be seen in novel Ulysses by James Joyce in which most of the incidents were works
                        of the mind and consciousness. In the Post-Modern period, after the Second World War, the main caracteristic
                        of the style of writers was that they were all more optimistic and the audience had a whole new idea
                        of artists as well. In fact, artists could change people's way of thinking and help them see the
                        reality.
