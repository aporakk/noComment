                <p>Hello and thanks for having a look in our Website for Classic Literature! I'm 19 years old and a student
                    at City College of Sheffield's department in Thessaloniki and this was our first group project. I'm currently
                    studying Computer Science and the first semester is almost over. Following the studies for computers
                    was my plan B, after giving up in pharmacy since I realized it wasn't something that I'd really like
                    to do. I'm a cinephile, I could watch movies, anytime during the days. My favorite movie is the Lord
                    of the Rings series. I like reading books in my free time and going to the cinemas. Travelling, reading
                    books, having time with my beloved ones and playing games can actually make me feel really good. If you
                    have any suggestions or questions regarding our website you can contact me if you hit the link above.</p>
