	<h2>What is a classic</h2>
	<p>A key feature of a classic piece of literary work is its artistic value. If it is a piece of work that could be inspiratory to later people overall, then that alone validates its artistic quality.</p>
	<p>Another important aspect that a classic has to have is depicting the conditions of the time it was written. By connecting the world in the mind of the composer with the physical world at that time, such a book achieves being a great reference for multiple
		purposes.</p>
	<p>Last but not least, a book is considered classic when many different kinds of people can read it and have a somewhat similar experience. Such a book breaks the barriers of diversity and depicts the higher values of humanity.</p>
